    <p>this game has a particular way of acting which is described below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            on first load there will be a heading saying the game's name,<br>
            there will be a start button to load the game board,<br>
            there will be a about section to READ ABOUT THE GAME.
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>
            After clickin the start button <br>
            there will be two indicators right below the game heading. <br>
            TurnX will always have the first turn which is indicated by the <br>
            indicator being gray in color. <br>
            This indicator will alternatively show each players turns in time <br>
            of playing. 
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>
            The process of playing the game is simple <br>
            yet functional. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Keeping in mind that the player X will have the first turn, <br>
                    players can choose to go first opting for player X or <br>
                    they can go for second turn to choose O. <br>
                    <strong>none of the player choices effects the actual game playe for any of the players nor does it change ho the winner is calculated. <br>
                    Winner is strictly dicded based on the inputs given by the player.</strong>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    By just simply clicking on the board boxes of choices <br>
                    keeping in mind of the turns playes can place there choosen markers <br>
                    on the board.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    winning rule is simple: corner to corner cover 3 boxes with same marker <br>
                    side to side or may that be up side down, but a player's marker has to cover <br>
                    atleast 3 boxes in a straight line to win.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>
            Winner will be declared after winning the game <br>
            in form of a text appearing just under there game heading <br>
            including the the marker name "x" or "o" in the text.
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>
            what happens after the player wins? <br>
            = after the player wins, and text has popped up, <br>
            the user can click on the restart button which will basically <br>
            reload the page to restart the game. <br>
            restart button? <br>
            = restart button refreshes the page. Not convinient <br>
            but this is just Version 1.0 and more features will be <br>
            added in the next version. 
        </li>
    </ol>

    <strong>Why i bothered to make a TicTacToe Game?</strong>
    <br>
    <p>
        well i have seen people making TicTacToe games online using js. <br>
        But i have seen very few people acvtually trying to solve the biggest problem <br>
        about a TicTacToe game, it's about making the logic behind the game which actually <br>
        evaulates the results. people makes beautifull versions of this game but very few try <br>
        try to focus on the core logic behind this. <br>
        my idea here is to explode this logic as many different ways as possible <br>
        by improving the game in versions/generations. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Most importantly my goal is to learn more things along the way of updating the game.</strong>
